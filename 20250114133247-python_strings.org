#+title: Python Strings
* Do not forget to add the corresponding explanation of string[i] in [[id:2aaa0de3-6fab-4b9c-aa29-2a7b2c91deb1][Chess Dictionary Validator]]
* Strings
A string in python can be thought as a non mutable list of characters, so we can use some of the functions and tools that we applied to lists.
** Tools
*** len function
With the ~len(str)~ function we can get the lenght of the string.
**** Use Cases
***** Check for password lenght
#+begin_src python
password = input("Write a password: ")
if len(password) < 14:
    print("Sorry, but password must be at least 14 characters long")
else:
    print("Password is ok")
#+end_src
*** Acces characters of a string
To acces a character of a string we use the index syntax or we can slice it, like a list.
=Remember that strings are non mutable so we can't change one character of the string, we can only check what is the character in an x position of the string=
**** Use Cases
***** Check for domain of a url
This program just check if an url is a .com domain url
#+begin_src python
urls = ["google.com", "Hola, Jaime", "ejemplo.com", "Maria"]
for url in urls:
    domain = url[-4:]
    if domain == ".com":
        print("It is a .com url")
    else:
        print("It is not a .com url")
#+end_src
