# Study System


<a id="org76ea877"></a>

## General Case

My approach to study will be formed by three readings (superficial, concepts , details), testing and note taking. I am using the theory of this video <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2rtSSM-C91I> by Justing Sung. In the video Justing talk about learning in four layers: logic, concepts, important details, arbitrary details.
I will use **mind maps** to "take notes" during my study sessions. Well, I will work like this:

### 1. Superficial Reading: Logic Layer

This reading could be during my study sessions, but it could also be done in other situations while I am waiting something like during transportation.

-   **Pick the big concepts and try to make sense of them:** For this I can just look for bold words, vocabulary, titles, images, etc. I just want to get an idea of what I will learn, I can read or watch the material really fast, the importante thing is to try to organize the concepts in a way that make sense for me.
-   **Time:** Approx. 10 min

### 2. Concept reading: Concept Layer

This is the heavy reading. I have to be in this layer most of the time.

-   **Develop First layer concepts**: In this layer/reading I want to explore and expand the concepts that I already have. During this work I will have to change the mind map that I already had in the first reading in order to organize the information in a better way. The important thing her is that *after every ending of a concept I have to take some steps back and thing how it connects with the rest*
-   **Time:** Necessary

### 3. Detail Reading: Important Details and arbitrary details

This reading is for looking and trying to make sense of "random" information. The **important** details are the ones that fit in some way in my mind map. The **arbitrary** details are the ones that don't fit, but it could be interesting to know. In order to learn the details I could use flashcards.

-   **Categorize Details**: I will look at information that during the first two reading doesn't seem important or seem random, I will question if it has some way to fit in the mind map. If it fits, then that is an important detail. Otherwise, it is an arbitrary detail.
-   **Time**: Approx. 10 min

### 4. Testing

I will create a simple test to see how well I learned the material, I will use Bloom's taxonomy as a reference.

### 5. Note Taking

I will pass the mind map to notes following the zettelkasten method and the system that I had stablish for my note taking system in org-roam.

## Particular Cases

Ther may be some extras rules or steps for some special cases.

### TextBooks

Textbooks usually come with solved and unsolved exercises. During the second reading I will have to be able to solve by myself the example exercises, I will have to repeat the exercise many times until I am able to solve it by myself.
The testing part will change depending of the unsolve exercises and questions that the textbook could have, for example: if the textbook only has exercises, then the testing will have some deep questions about the concepts.
